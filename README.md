**RKS** - is app in `React.js`. This project helps people to find RKS OÃœ - a car painting shop.

To build the application I use ready-made components from `react-bootstrap`, 
 `react-router`, which contains the main functionality for working with routing. In work with the browser, I use the module `react-router-dom`, by wrapping the components in `App.js`.
 Also i used: `sass`, `styled-components`, `react-icons`, `react-hook-form`, `react-compare-image`, `framer-motion` npm packages.

 Application consists of 5 pages:<br>
 `Home` - homepage with general description painting shop.<br>
 `Services` - describes the services that the paint shop performs.<br>
 `Our work` - some examples of the paint shop work.<br>
 `About us` - information about the service and partners.<br>
 `Contacts` - paint shop contacts and quick contact form via mail.

 This project was created in 3 languages: Estonian, English and Russian. This feature was created with `react-router`.

 The project is planned to improve over time, maintain and update.
